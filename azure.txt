To create a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure Portal while disabling the public IP, you can follow these steps:

Sign in to the Azure Portal:
Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account.

Click on "Create a resource":
On the Azure Portal dashboard, click on the "+ Create a resource" button.

Search for "Virtual Machine":
In the "Search the Marketplace" box, type "Virtual Machine" and select it from the search results.

Click "Create" on the Virtual Machine blade:
You'll be taken to a page where you can configure your VM.

Basics:
Fill in the basic information for your VM, including:

Subscription
Resource Group
Virtual Machine Name
Region
Availability Options (if needed)
Image (e.g., Windows, Linux)
Size
Authentication:
Choose how you want to authenticate to the VM. You can use SSH key (for Linux) or a username/password (for Windows). Make sure to create your credentials.

Disks:
Configure your VM's storage settings, including the OS disk and any additional data disks you may need.

Networking:
In the "Networking" tab, you can configure your VM's network settings. To disable the public IP, follow these steps:

Under the "Virtual network" section, select an existing virtual network or create a new one.
For "Public inbound ports," select "None" to disable public access.
For "NIC network security group," you can leave it as is or configure a network security group for additional security rules if necessary.
Management:
Configure management settings such as monitoring, diagnostics, and boot diagnostics according to your preferences.

Advanced:
You can set up various advanced settings here, but make sure to check that public IP remains disabled.

Tags (optional):
Add tags to your VM for better organization and management.

Review + create:
Review all the settings you've configured, and when you're ready, click the "Create" button.

Deployment:
Azure will start creating the VM based on your configuration. You can monitor the deployment progress on the Azure Portal.

Once the deployment is complete, you'll have a Virtual Machine in Azure without a public IP address, which means it won't be accessible from the public internet. You can access it via private IP or by setting up a VPN or Azure Bastion if you need secure remote access.
